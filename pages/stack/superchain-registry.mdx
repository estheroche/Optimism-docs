# Superchain Registry Explainer

<Callout type="warning">
  The [superchain registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/tree/main) is a work in progress and still must be approved by Optimism Governance. Until that time, the configuration described here is subject to change.
</Callout>

This page provides a holistic view of Superchain configurations, covering mainnet and testnet targets, member chains, contract permissions, and tools for contributing new chains or superchains. 
The goal is to offer essential data for seamless integration into OP Stack software while facilitating the derivation of complete deployment artifacts.

The Superchain Registry is a critical component of the Optimism ecosystem, particularly in managing the inclusion and
configuration of Layer 2 (L2) chains within the Superchain framework. Optimism's vision for scalability involves the
creation of a network of L2 chains, referred to as the Superchain, which leverages the OP Stack—a modular and open-source
set of tools for building these chains.

*   The Superchain Registry functions as an index that tracks which chains are part of the Superchain.
*   The registry ensures transparency by documenting the configuration parameters for each chain, such as their protocol versions and governance settings.
*   The registry is essential for maintaining consistency and security across the network by verifying that all included chains meet the criteria set forth by their
    respective [Blockspace Charters](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133)​.
    Also see [chain addresses](/chain/addresses)​ for more information.

## Superchain Configuration

The Superchain Registry repository hosts Superchain-configuration data in a minimal human-readable form.
This includes mainnet and testnet Superchain targets and their respective member chains.

Other configuration, such as contract-permissions, and `SystemConfig` parameters are hosted and governed onchain.

The superchain configs are made available in minimal form, to embed in OP Stack software.
Full deployment artifacts and genesis-states can be derived from the minimal form using the reference [op-chain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-chain-ops) tooling.

## Semantic Versioning Lockfiles

Semantic Versioning Lockfiles (`semver.yaml`) are used to lock the versions of contracts and tools to specific releases.
This ensures that all deployments are consistent and predictable, preventing issues that might arise from version mismatches.
These lockfiles adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), which is a versioning scheme for software that aims to convey meaning about the underlying changes with each release.

The `semver.yaml` files each represent the semantic versioning lockfile for all the smart contracts in that superchain.
It is meant to be used when building transactions that upgrade the implementations set in the proxies.

If you would like to contribute a new chain or superchain, please see our [contributing guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Superchain Go Module

Superchain configs can be imported as Go-module:

` go get github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/superchain@latest`

See [op-chain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-chain-ops) for config tooling and for smart-contract bindings.

## Validation Go Module

A second module exists in this repo whose purpose is to validate the config exported by the `superchain` module.
It is a separate module to avoid import cycles and polluting downstream dependencies with things like `go-ethereum`
(which is used in the validation tests).
The modules are tracked by a top-level go.work file.
The associated `go.work.sum` file is gitignored and not crucial to [typical workflows]
(https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml).

## CheckSecurityConfigs

The `CheckSecurityConfigs.s.sol` script is used in CI to perform security checks of OP Chains registered in the superchain directory.
At high level, it performs checks to ensure privileges are properly granted to the right addresses.
More specifically, it checks the following privilege grants and role designations:

<Steps>
  ### Generic Privileges

  *   Proxy admins. For example, `L1ERC721BridgeProxy` and `OptimismMintableERC20FactoryProxy` specify
      the proxy admin addresses who can change their implementations.
  *   Address managers. For example, `ProxyAdmin` specifies the address manager it trusts to look up certain addresses by name.
  *   Contract owners. For example, many `Ownable` contracts use this role to specify the message senders allowed to make privileged calls.

  ### Optimism Privileged Cross-contract Calls

  *   Trusted messengers. For example, `L1ERC721BridgeProxy` and `L1StandardBridgeProxy` specify
      the cross domain messenger address they trust with cross domain message sender information.
  *   Trusted bridges. For example, `OptimismMintableERC20FactoryProxy` specifies
      the L1 standard bridge it trusts to mint and burn tokens.
  *   Trusted portal. For example, `L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy` specifies
      the portal it trusts to deposit transactions and get L2 senders.
  *   Trusted oracles. For example, `OptimismPortalProxy` specifies the L2 oracle they trust with the L2 state root information.
        <Callout type="info">
        After the FPAC upgrade, the `OptimismPortalProxy` specifies the `DisputeGameFactory` they trust rather than the legacy `L2OutputOracle` contract.
        </Callout>
  *   Trusted system config. For example, `OptimismPortalProxy` specifies the system config they trust to get resource config from. TODO(issues/37): add checks for the ResourceMetering contract.

  ### Optimism Privileged Operational Roles

  *   Guardians. This is the role that can pause withdraws in the Optimism protocol.
      *   After the FPAC upgrade, the `Guardian` can also blacklist dispute games and change the respected game type in the `OptimismPortal`.
  *   Challengers. This is the role that can delete `L2OutputOracleProxy`'s output roots in the Optimism protocol.
        <Callout type="info">
        After the FPAC upgrade, the `CHALLENGER` is a permissionless role in the `FaultDisputeGame`.
        However, in the PermissionedDisputeGame, the `CHALLENGER` role is the only party allowed to dispute
        output proposals created by the `PROPOSER` role.
        </Callout>
</Steps>

  As a result, here is a visualization of all the relationships the `CheckSecurityConfigs.s.sol` script checks:
