# Overview of the Superchain Registry

<Callout type="info">
   ⚠️ This repository is a work in progress. At a later date, it will be proposed to, and must be approved by, Optimism Governance. Until that time, the configuration described here is subject to change.

</Callout>

The Superchain Registry repository hosts Superchain-configuration data in a minimal human-readable form. 
This includes mainnet and testnet Superchain targets, and their respective member chains.

Other configuration, such as contract-permissions, and `SystemConfig` parameters are hosted and governed onchain.

The superchain configs are made available in minimal form, to embed in OP-Stack software. 
Full deployment artifacts and genesis-states can be derived from the minimal form using the reference [op-chain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-chain-ops) tooling.

The `semver.yaml` files each represent the semantic versioning lockfile for all the smart contracts in that superchain.
 It is meant to be used when building transactions that upgrade the implementations set in the proxies.

If you would like to contribute a new chain or superchain, please see our [contributing guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Superchain Go Module
Superchain configs can be imported as Go-module:

``` go get github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/superchain@latest```

See [op-chain-ops](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-chain-ops) for config tooling and for smart-contract bindings.

# Validation Go Module

A second module exists in this repo whose purpose is to validate the config exported by the `superchain` module. 
It is a separate module to avoid import cycles and polluting downstream dependencies with things like `go-ethereum` 
(which is used in the validation tests). 
The modules are tracked by a top-level go.work file.
The associated `go.work.sum` file is gitignored and not crucial to typical workflows,
(perchain-registry/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml).

# CheckSecurityConfigs

The `CheckSecurityConfigs.s.sol` script is used in CI to perform security checks of OP Chains registered in the superchain directory. 
At high level, it performs checks to ensure privileges are properly granted to the right addresses. 
More specifically, it checks the following privilege grants and role designations:

### 1. Generic privileges:

i. Proxy admins. For example, `L1ERC721BridgeProxy` and `OptimismMintableERC20FactoryProxy` specify 
the proxy admin addresses who can change their implementations.

ii. Address managers. For example, `ProxyAdmin` specifies the address manager it trusts to look up certain addresses by name.
iii. Contract owners. For example, many `Ownable` contracts use this role to specify the message senders allowed to make privileged calls.

### 2. Optimism privileged cross-contract calls:

i. Trusted messengers. For example, `L1ERC721BridgeProxy` and `L1StandardBridgeProxy` specify 
    the cross domain messenger address they trust with cross domain message sender information.
ii. Trusted bridges. For example, `OptimismMintableERC20FactoryProxy` specifies 
the L1 standard bridge it trusts to mint and burn tokens.
iii. Trusted portal. For example, `L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy` specifies 
the portal it trusts to deposit transactions and get L2 senders.
iv. Trusted oracles. For example, `OptimismPortalProxy` specifies the L2 oracle they trust with the L2 state root information.
a. After the FPAC upgrade, the `OptimismPortalProxy` specifies the `DisputeGameFactory` they trust rather than the legacy `L2OutputOracle` contract. 
v. Trusted system config. For example, `OptimismPortalProxy` specifies the system config they trust to get resource config from. TODO(issues/37): add checks for the ResourceMetering contract.
3. Optimism privileged operational roles:

i. Guardians. This is the role that can pause withdraws in the Optimism protocol.
    a. After the FPAC upgrade, the `Guardian` can also blacklist dispute games and change the respected game type in the `OptimismPortal`.
ii. Challengers. This is the role that can delete `L2OutputOracleProxy`'s output roots in the Optimism protocol 
a. After the FPAC upgrade, the `CHALLENGER` is a permissionless role in the `FaultDisputeGame`. 
However, in the PermissionedDisputeGame, the `CHALLENGER` role is the only party allowed to dispute 
output proposals created by the `PROPOSER` role.

            
As a result, here is a visualization of all the relationships the CheckSecurityConfigs.s.sol script checks:

  L1ERC721BridgeProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin
  L1ERC721BridgeProxy -- "messenger()" --> L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy

  OptimismMintableERC20FactoryProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin
  OptimismMintableERC20FactoryProxy -- "BRIDGE()" --> L1StandardBridgeProxy

  ProxyAdmin -- "addressManager()" --> AddressManager
  ProxyAdmin -- "owner()" --> ProxyOwnerMultisig

  L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy -- "PORTAL()" --> OptimismPortalProxy
  L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy -- "addressManager[address(this)]" --> AddressManager

  L1StandardBridgeProxy -- "getOwner()" -->  ProxyAdmin
  L1StandardBridgeProxy -- "messenger()" --> L1CrossDomainMessengerProxy

  AddressManager -- "owner()" -->  ProxyAdmin

  OptimismPortalProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin
  OptimismPortalProxy -- "GUARDIAN()" --> GuardianMultisig
  OptimismPortalProxy -- "L2_ORACLE()" --> L2OutputOracleProxy
  OptimismPortalProxy -- "SYSTEM_CONFIG()" --> SystemConfigProxy
  OptimismPortalProxy -- "disputeGameFactory()" --> DisputeGameFactoryProxy

  L2OutputOracleProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin
  L2OutputOracleProxy -- "CHALLENGER()" --> ChallengerMultisig

  SystemConfigProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin
  SystemConfigProxy -- "owner()" --> SystemConfigOwnerMultisig

  DisputeGameFactoryProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin
  DisputeGameFactoryProxy -- "owner()" --> ProxyAdminOwner

  AnchorStateRegistryProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin

  DelayedWETHProxy -- "admin()" --> ProxyAdmin
  DelayedWETHProxy -- "owner()" --> ProxyAdminOwner
